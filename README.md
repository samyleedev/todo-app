## Overview

Here is the "EinsenhowerTodoApp". Add a todo, associate it to an importance rating and an urgency rating. Then visualize your tasks on a list view, or better, on an Eisenhower matrix ! It will help you to see in the blink of an eye which task you have to prioritize, and which one you could throw away !
